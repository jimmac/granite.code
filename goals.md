## Goals  

Our mission with Paver and Granite is to redefine how developers interact with AI in their coding workflows. Here's what we're striving for: 

### **1. Runs Locally – No Data Leaves Your Computer**  
Your privacy matters. Paver ensures that all model computations happen on your local machine. Sensitive codebases, proprietary data, or personal projects never leave your environment, giving you peace of mind and complete control. 

### **2. Better Openness and Transparency for Granite Models**  
AI should not be a black box. We are committed to making the Granite models as transparent and accessible as possible. From clear documentation to open discussions about the model’s training data, performance, and limitations, we aim to empower developers with trust and understanding. 

### **3. A Vibrant Open Source Project**  
Paver is built on the belief that collaboration drives innovation. By fostering a strong community of contributors, we aim to create a sustainable and ever-evolving project that thrives on shared ideas, feedback, and support. 

### **4. Contribute Model Skills and Knowledge via InstructLab**  
InstructLab is the beating heart of the Granite ecosystem. Through this initiative, we enable contributors to expand the model's capabilities, teaching it new skills, improving its understanding of languages, and refining its context awareness—all while staying rooted in community-driven priorities. 

### **5. Model Variations Tailored to Specific Open Source Technologies or Codebases**  
One-size-fits-all doesn’t work for developers. Our goal is to create specialized variations of the Granite model that excel in particular open source technologies, frameworks, and even individual codebases. Whether you’re working on Kubernetes, React, or a niche Python library, Granite will have a model variation optimized for your needs. 

### **6. A Distinct UI Vision with Unique and Thoughtful Touches**  
We believe that design and usability are just as important as functionality. Paver aims to offer a user interface that’s clean, intuitive, and full of delightful details. From subtle animations to thoughtful workflow optimizations, the experience will feel both polished and personal.
